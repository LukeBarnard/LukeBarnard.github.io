<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher and my research focuses on how the Sun
creates and controls the space environment near Earth. Some of the
research questions I am working on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the limits to the predictability of space weather and what
factors influence this?</li>
<li>How can we best use heliospheric remote sensing data to improve
space weather forecasting?</li>
</ul>
<p>I tackle these questions using a combination of solar wind numerical
models, heliospheric remote sensing instruments, and novel data analysis
methods enabled by citizen science projects.</p>
