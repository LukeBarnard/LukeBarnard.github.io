	abstract = {Abstract. Measurements of thermospheric composition via ground-based instrumentation are challenging to make and so details about this important region of the upper atmosphere are currently sparse. We present a technique that deduces quantitative estimates of thermospheric composition from ionospheric data, for which there is a global network of stations. The visibility of the F1 peak in ionospheric soundings from ground-based instrumentation is a sensitive function of thermospheric composition. The ionospheric profile in the transition region between F1 and F2 peaks can be expressed by the G factor, a function of ion production rate and loss rates via ion-atom interchange reactions and dissociative recombination of molecular ions. This in turn can be expressed as the square of the ratio of ions lost via these processes. We compare estimates of the G factor obtained from ionograms recorded at Kwajalein (9\&deg;\&thinsp;N, 167.2\&deg;\&thinsp;E) for 25 times during which the TIMED spacecraft recorded approximately co-located measurements of the neutral thermosphere. We find a linear relationship between √G and the molecular: atomic composition ratio, with a gradient of 2.23\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.17 and an offset of 1.66\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.19. This relationship reveals the potential for using ground-based ionospheric measurements to infer quantitative variations in the composition of the neutral thermosphere. Such information can be used to investigate spatial and temporal variations in thermospheric composition which in turn has applications such as understanding the response of thermospheric composition to climate change and the efficacy of the upper atmosphere on satellite drag.},

	abstract = {© L. Barnard et al., Published by EDP Sciences 2018. Context: Cosmogenic isotopes provide useful estimates of past solar magnetic activity, constraining past space climate with reasonable uncertainty. Much less is known about past space weather conditions. Recent advances in the analysis of 10 Be by McCracken \& Beer (2015, Sol Phys 290: 305-3069) (MB15) suggest that annually resolved 10 Be can be significantly affected by solar energetic particle (SEP) fluxes. This poses a problem, and presents an opportunity, as the accurate quantification of past solar magnetic activity requires the SEP effects to be determined and isolated, whilst doing so might provide a valuable record of past SEP fluxes. Aims: We compare the MB15 reconstruction of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), with two independent estimates of the HMF derived from sunspot records and geomagnetic variability. We aim to quantify the differences between the HMF reconstructions, and speculate on the origin of these differences. We test whether the differences between the reconstructions appear to depend on known significant space weather events. Methods: We analyse the distributions of the differences between the HMF reconstructions. We consider how the differences vary as a function of solar cycle phase, and, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we compare the distributions under the two conditions of whether or not large space weather events were known to have occurred. Results: We find that the MB15 reconstructions are generally marginally smaller in magnitude than the sunspot and geomagnetic HMF reconstructions. This bias varies as a function of solar cycle phase, and is largest in the declining phase of the solar cycle. We find that MB15's excision of the years with very large ground level enhancement (GLE) improves the agreement of the 10 Be HMF estimate with the sunspot and geomagnetic reconstructions. We find no statistical evidence that GLEs, in general, affect the MB15 reconstruction, but this analysis is limited by having too few samples. We do find evidence that the MB15 reconstructions appear statistically different in years with great geomagnetic storms.},

	abstract = {The response of lightning rates over Europe to arrival of high speed solar wind streams at Earth is investigated using a superposed epoch analysis. Fast solar wind stream arrival is determined from modulation of the solar wind V  {\textless} inf {\textgreater} y {\textless} /inf {\textgreater}  component, measured by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft. Lightning rate changes around these event times are determined from the very low frequency arrival time difference (ATD) system of the UK Met Office. Arrival of high speed streams at Earth is found to be preceded by a decrease in total solar irradiance and an increase in sunspot number and Mg II emissions. These are consistent with the high speed stream's source being co-located with an active region appearing on the Eastern solar limb and rotating at the 27 d period of the Sun. Arrival of the high speed stream at Earth also coincides with a small (∼1\%) but rapid decrease in galactic cosmic ray flux, a moderate (∼6\%) increase in lower energy solar energetic protons (SEPs), and a substantial, statistically significant increase in lightning rates. These changes persist for around 40 d in all three quantities. The lightning rate increase is corroborated by an increase in the total number of thunder days observed by UK Met stations, again persisting for around 40 d after the arrival of a high speed solar wind stream. This result appears to contradict earlier studies that found an anti-correlation between sunspot number and thunder days over solar cycle timescales. The increase in lightning rates and thunder days that we observe coincides with an increased flux of SEPs which, while not being detected at ground level, nevertheless penetrate the atmosphere to tropospheric altitudes. This effect could be further amplified by an increase in mean lightning stroke intensity that brings more strokes above the detection threshold of the ATD system. In order to remove any potential seasonal bias the analysis was repeated for daily solar wind triggers occurring during the summer months (June to August). Though this reduced the number of solar wind triggers to 32, the response in both lightning and thunder day data remained statistically significant. This modulation of lightning by regular and predictable solar wind events may be beneficial to medium range forecasting of hazardous weather. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

For R G and φ, R 2 L (t) {\textgreater} 0.5 for times into the future of t ≈ 4 and ≈ 3 solar cycles, respectively: sufficient to allow prediction of a GSMi onset. The lower predictability of sunspot number R Z is discussed.

Predictions of the arrival of four coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in geospace are produced through use of three CME geometric models combined with CME drag modeling, constraining these models with the available Coronagraph and Heliospheric Imager data. The efficacy of these predications is assessed by comparison with the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) numerical MHD forecasts of these same events. It is found that such a prediction technique cannot outperform the standard SWPC forecast at a statistically meaningful level. We test the Harmonic Mean, Self-Similar Expansion, and Ellipse Evolution geometric models, and find that, for these events at least, the differences between the models are smaller than the observational errors. We present a new method of characterizing CME fronts in the Heliospheric Imager field of view, utilizing the analysis of citizen scientists working with the Solar Stormwatch project, and we demonstrate that this provides a more accurate representation of the CME front than is obtained by experts analyzing elongation time maps for the studied events. Comparison of the CME kinematics estimated independently from the STEREO-A and STEREO-B Heliospheric Imager data reveals inconsistencies that cannot be explained within the observational errors and model assumptions. We argue that these observations imply that the assumptions of the CME geometric models are routinely invalidated and question their utility in a space weather forecasting context. These results argue for the continuing development of more advanced techniques to better exploit the Heliospheric Imager observations for space weather forecasting.},

Using historic datasets from the Slough and Washington ionosondes, we evaluate the best statistical fits of foF2 to sunspot numbers (at each Universal Time [UT] separately) in order to search for drifts and abrupt changes in the fit residuals over Solar Cycles 17 – 21. This test is carried out for the original composite of the Wolf/Zürich/International sunspot number [R] , the new “backbone” group sunspot number [R BB ], and the proposed “corrected sunspot number” [R C ]. Polynomial fits are made both with and without allowance for the white-light facular area, which has been reported as being associated with cycle-to-cycle changes in the sunspot-number–foF2 relationship. Over the interval studied here, R, R BB , and R C largely differ in their allowance for the “Waldmeier discontinuity” around 1945 (the correction factor for which for R, R BB , and R C is, respectively, zero, effectively over 20 \%, and explicitly 11.6 \%). It is shown that for Solar Cycles 18 – 21, all three sunspot data sequences perform well, but that the fit residuals are lowest and most uniform for R BB . We here use foF2 for those UTs for which R, R BB , and R C all give correlations exceeding 0.99 for intervals both before and after the Waldmeier discontinuity. The error introduced by the Waldmeier discontinuity causes R to underestimate the fitted values based on the foF2 data for 1932 – 1945, but R BB overestimates them by almost the same factor, implying that the correction for the Waldmeier discontinuity inherent in R BB is too large by a factor of two. Fit residuals are smallest and most uniform for R C , and the ionospheric data support the optimum discontinuity multiplicative correction factor derived from the independent Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) sunspot group data for the same interval.},

The proposed mechanism is two-step: lightning rates vary with galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux incident on Earth, either via changes in atmospheric conductivity and/or direct triggering of lightning. GCR flux is, in turn, primarily controlled by the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) intensity. Consequently, global changes in lightning rates are expected. This study instead considers HMF polarity, which doesnt greatly affect total GCR flux. Opposing HMF polarities are, however, associated with a 40-60\% difference in observed UK lightning and thunder rates. As HMF polarity skews the terrestrial magnetosphere from its nominal position, this perturbs local ionospheric potential at high latitudes and local exposure to energetic charged particles from the magnetosphere. We speculate as to the mechanism(s) by which this may, in turn, redistribute the global location and/or intensity of thunderstorm activity.},

Space Res.40, 919, 2007 and Clette et al. in The Solar Activity Cycle35, Springer, New York, 2015); the corrected version of R ISNv1 proposed by Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard (J. Geophys. Res.119, 5193, 2014a) [R C ]; the new “backbone” group-number composite proposed by Svalgaard and Schatten (Solar Phys.291, 2016) [R BB ]; and the new group-number composite derived by Usoskin et al. (Solar Phys.291, 2016) [R UEA ]. The test data series used are the group-number [N G ] and total sunspot area [A G ] from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich/Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) photoheliographic data; the Ca K index from the recent re-analysis of Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) spectroheliograms in the Calcium ii K ion line; the sunspot-group-number from the MWO sunspot drawings [N MWO ]; and the dayside ionospheric F2-region critical frequencies measured by the Slough ionosonde [foF2] . These test data all vary in close association with sunspot numbers, in some cases non-linearly. The tests are carried out using both the before-and-after fit-residual comparison method and the correlation method of Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard, applied to annual mean data for intervals iterated to minimise errors and to eliminate uncertainties associated with the precise date of the putative discontinuity. It is not assumed that the correction required is by a constant factor, nor even linear in sunspot number. It is shown that a non-linear correction is required by R C , R BB , and R ISNv1 , but not by R ISNv2 or R UEA . The five test datasets give very similar results in all cases. By multiplying the probability distribution functions together, we obtain the optimum correction for each sunspot dataset that must be applied to pre-discontinuity data to make them consistent with the post-discontinuity data. It is shown that, on average, values for 1932 – 1943 are too low (relative to later values) by about 12.3 \% for R ISNv1 but are too high for R ISNv2 and R BB by 3.8 \% and 5.2 \%, respectively. The correction that was applied to generate R C from R ISNv1 reduces this average factor to 0.5 \% but does not remove the non-linear variation with the test data, and other errors remain uncorrected. A valuable test of the procedures used is provided by R UEA , which is identical to the RGO N G values over the interval employed.},

	abstract = {We present a new composite of geomagnetic activity which is designed to be as homogeneous in its construction as possible. This is done by only combining data that, by virtue of the locations of the source observatories used, have similar responses to solar wind and IMF (interplanetary magnetic field) variations. This will enable us (in Part 2, Lockwood et al., 2013a) to use the new index to reconstruct the interplanetary magnetic field, B, back to 1846 with a full analysis of errors. Allowance is made for the effects of secular change in the geomagnetic field. The composite uses interdiurnal variation data from Helsinki for 1845-1890 (inclusive) and 1893-1896 and from Eskdalemuir from 1911 to the present. The gaps are filled using data from the Potsdam (1891-1892 and 1897-1907) and the nearby Seddin observatories (1908-1910) and intercalibration achieved using the Potsdam-Seddin sequence. The new index is termed IDV(1d) because it employs many of the principles of the IDV index derived by Svalgaard and Cliver (2010), inspired by the u index of Bartels (1932); however, we revert to using one-day (1d) means, as employed by Bartels, because the use of near-midnight values in IDV introduces contamination by the substorm current wedge auroral electrojet, giving noise and a dependence on solar wind speed that varies with latitude. The composite is compared with independent, early data from European-sector stations, Greenwich, St Petersburg, Parc St Maur, and Ekaterinburg, as well as the composite u index, compiled from 2-6 stations by Bartels, and the IDV index of Svalgaard and Cliver. Agreement is found to be extremely good in all cases, except two. Firstly, the Greenwich data are shown to have gradually degraded in quality until new instrumentation was installed in 1915. Secondly, we infer that the Bartels u index is increasingly unreliable before about 1886 and overestimates the solar cycle amplitude between 1872 and 1883 and this is amplified in the proxy data used before 1872. This is therefore also true of the IDV index which makes direct use of the u index values. © Author(s) 2013.},

	abstract = {©2015. The Authors. Observations from the Heliospheric Imager (HI) instruments aboard the twin STEREO spacecraft have enabled the compilation of several catalogues of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), each characterizing the propagation of CMEs through the inner heliosphere. Three such catalogues are the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL)-HI event list, the Solar Stormwatch CME catalogue, and, presented here, the J-tracker catalogue. Each catalogue uses a different method to characterize the location of CME fronts in the HI images: manual identification by an expert, the statistical reduction of the manual identifications of many citizen scientists, and an automated algorithm. We provide a quantitative comparison of the differences between these catalogues and techniques, using 51 CMEs common to each catalogue. The time-elongation profiles of these CME fronts are compared, as are the estimates of the CME kinematics derived from application of three widely used single-spacecraft-fitting techniques. The J-tracker and RAL-HI profiles are most similar, while the Solar Stormwatch profiles display a small systematic offset. Evidence is presented that these differences arise because the RAL-HI and J-tracker profiles follow the sunward edge of CME density enhancements, while Solar Stormwatch profiles track closer to the antisunward (leading) edge. We demonstrate that the method used to produce the time-elongation profile typically introduces more variability into the kinematic estimates than differences between the various single-spacecraft-fitting techniques. This has implications for the repeatability and robustness of these types of analyses, arguably especially so in the context of space weather forecasting, where it could make the results strongly dependent on the methods used by the forecaster.},

Solar activity during the current sunspot minimum has fallen to levels unknown since the start of the 20th century (Lockwood 2010 Proc. R. Soc. A 466 303-29) and records of past solar variations inferred from cosmogenic isotopes (Abreu et al 2008 Geophys.Res.Lett. 35 L20109) and geomagnetic activity data (Lockwood et al 2009 Astrophys.

Combining cosmogenic isotope data with the long record of temperatures measured in central England, we estimate how solar change could influence the probability in the future of further UK winters that are cold, relative to the hemispheric mean temperature, if all other factors remain constant. Global warming is taken into account only through the detrending using mea n hemispheric temperatures.

	abstract = {© 2016, The Author(s). We use sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) to investigate the effects of intercalibrating data from observers with different visual acuities. The tests are made by counting the number of groups [R B ] above a variable cut-off threshold of observed total whole spot area (uncorrected for foreshortening) to simulate what a lower-acuity observer would have seen. The synthesised annual means of R B are then re-scaled to the full observed RGO group number [ R A ] using a variety of regression techniques. It is found that a very high correlation between R A and R B (r AB {\textgreater}  0.98) does not prevent large errors in the intercalibration (for example sunspot-maximum values can be over 30 \% too large even for such levels of r AB ). In generating the backbone sunspot number [R BB ] , Svalgaard and Schatten (Solar Phys., 2016) force regression fits to pass through the scatter-plot origin, which generates unreliable fits (the residuals do not form a normal distribution) and causes sunspot-cycle amplitudes to be exaggerated in the intercalibrated data. It is demonstrated that the use of Quantile–Quantile (“Q–Q”) plots to test for a normal distribution is a useful indicator of erroneous and misleading regression fits. Ordinary least-squares linear fits, not forced to pass through the origin, are sometimes reliable (although the optimum method used is shown to be different when matching peak and average sunspot-group numbers). However, other fits are only reliable if non-linear regression is used. From these results it is entirely possible that the inflation of solar-cycle amplitudes in the backbone group sunspot number as one goes back in time, relative to related solar–terrestrial parameters, is entirely caused by the use of inappropriate and non-robust regression techniques to calibrate the sunspot data.},

	abstract = {The recent solar minimum was the longest and deepest of the space age, with the lowest average sunspot numbers for nearly a century. The Sun appears to be exiting a grand solar maximum (GSM) of activity which has persisted throughout the space age, and is headed into a significantly quieter period. Indeed, initial observations of solar cycle 24 (SC24) continue to show a relatively low heliospheric magnetic field strength and sunspot number (R), despite the average latitude of sunspots and the inclination of the heliospheric current sheet showing the rise to solar maximum is well underway. We extrapolate the available SC24 observations forward in time by assuming R will continue to follow a similar form to previous cycles, despite the end of the GSM, and predict a very weak cycle 24, with R peaking at ∼65-75 around the middle/end of 2012. Similarly, we estimate the heliospheric magnetic field strength will peak around 6nT. We estimate that average galactic cosmic ray fluxes above 1GV rigidity will be ∼10\% higher in SC24 than SC23 and that the probability of a large SEP event during this cycle is 0.8, compared to 0.5 for SC23. Comparison of the SC24 R estimates with previous ends of GSMs inferred from 9300 years of cosmogenic isotope data places the current evolution of the Sun and heliosphere in the lowest 5\% of cases, suggesting Maunder Minimum conditions are likely within the next 40 years.

Using information on geomagnetic activity, sunspot numbers and cosmogenic isotopes, supported by historic eclipse images and in conjunction with models, it has been possible to reconstruct annual means of solar wind speed and number density and heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) intensity since 1611, when telescopic observations of sunspots began. These models are developed and tuned using data recorded by near-Earth interplanetary spacecraft and by solar magnetograms over the past 53 years. In this paper, we use these reconstructions to quantify power input into the magnetosphere over the past 400 years. For each year, both the annual mean power input is computed and its distribution in daily means. This is possible because the distribution of daily values divided by the annual mean is shown to maintain the same lognormal form with a constant variance. This study is another important step towards the development of a physics-based, long-term climatology of space weather conditions.},

We use data from the modern Nurmijarvi station, relatively close to the site of the original Helsinki Observatory, to confirm a 30\% underestimation in this interval and hence our results are fully consistent with the correction derived by Svalgaard. We show that the best method for recalibration uses the Helsinki Ak (H) and aa indices and is accurate to ±10\%. This makes it preferable to recalibration using either the sunspot number or the diurnal range of geomagnetic activity which we find to be accurate to ±20\%. In the case of Helsinki data during cycle 11, the two recalibration methods produce very similar corrections which are here confirmed using newly digitised data from the nearby St Petersburg observatory and also using declination data from Helsinki. However, we show that the IDV index is, compared to later years, too similar to sunspot number before 1872, revealing independence of the two data series has been lost; either because the geomagnetic data used to compile IDV has  been corrected using sunspot numbers, or vice versa, or both. We present corrected data sequences for both the IDV(1d) index and the reconstructed IMF (interplanetary magnetic field). We also analyse the relationship between the derived near-Earth IMF and the sunspot number and point out the relevance of the prior history of solar activity, in addition to the contemporaneous value, to estimating any "floor" value of the near-Earth interplanetary field. © 2014 Author(s).},

Part 1 produced composite estimates of B from geomagnetic and sunspot data over the period 1750–2013. Sunspot-based reconstructions can be extended back to 1610, but the paleocosmic ray (PCR) record is the only data set capable of providing a record of solar activity on millennial timescales. The process for converting 10 Be concentrations measured in ice cores to B is more complex than with geomagnetic and sunspot data, and the uncertainties in B derived from cosmogenic nuclides ({\textasciitilde}20\% for any individual year) are much larger. Within this level of uncertainty, we find reasonable overall agreement between PCR-based B and the geomagnetic- and sunspot number-based series. This agreement was enhanced by excising low values in PCR-based B attributed to high-energy solar proton events. Other discordant intervals, with as yet unspecified causes remain included in our analysis. Comparison of 3 year averages centered on sunspot minimum yields reasonable agreement between the three estimates, providing a means to investigate the long-term changes in the heliospheric magnetic field into the past even without a means to remove solar proton events from the records.},

Of the 60 predictions of Earth-directed CMEs, 20 resulted in an identifiable Interplanetary CME (ICME) at Earth within 1.5-6 days, with an average error in predicted transit time of 22 h, and average transit time of 82.3 h. The average error in predicting arrival speed is 151 km s -1 , with an average arrival speed of 425km s -1 . In the same time period, there were 44 CMEs for which there are no corresponding SSW predictions, and there were 600 days on which there was neither a CME predicted nor observed. A number of metrics show that the SSW predictions do have useful forecast skill; however, there is still much room for improvement. We investigate potential improvements by using SSW inputs in three models of ICME propagation: two of constant acceleration and one of aerodynamic drag.

Southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) reference frame is the key element that controls the level of space weather disturbance in Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere. We discuss the relation of this geoeffective IMF component to the IMF in the geocentric solar ecliptic (GSE) frame, and using the almost continuous interplanetary data for 1996–2015 (inclusive), we show that large geomagnetic storms are always associated with strong southward, out-of-ecliptic field in the GSE frame: Dipole tilt effects, which cause the difference between the southward field in the GSM and GSE frames, generally make only a minor contribution to these strongest storms. The time-of-day/time-of-year response patterns of geomagnetic indices and the optimum solar wind coupling function are both influenced by the timescale of the index response. We also study the occurrence spectrum of large out-of-ecliptic field and show that for 1 h averages it is, surprisingly, almost identical in ICMEs (interplanetary coronal mass ejections), around CIRs/SIRs (corotating and stream interaction regions) and in the “quiet” solar wind (which is shown to be consistent with the effect of weak SIRs). However, differences emerge when the timescale over which the field remains southward is considered: for longer averaging timescales the spectrum is broader inside ICMEs, showing that these events generate longer intervals of strongly southward average IMF and consequently stronger geomagnetic storms. The behavior of out-of-ecliptic field with timescale is shown to be very similar to that of deviations from the predicted Parker spiral orientation, suggesting the two share common origins.},

Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux is modulated by both particle drift patterns and solar wind structures on a range of timescales. Over solar cycles, GCR flux varies as a function of the total open solar magnetic flux and the latitudinal extent of the heliospheric current sheet. Over hours, drops of a few percent in near-Earth GCR flux (Forbush decreases, FDs) are well known to be associated with the near-Earth passage of solar wind structures resulting from corotating interaction regions (CIRs) and transient coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We report on four FDs seen at ground-based neutron monitors which cannot be immediately associated with significant structures in the local solar wind. Similarly, there are significant near-Earth structures which do not produce any corresponding GCR variation. Three of the FDs are during the STEREO era, enabling in situ and remote observations from three well-separated heliospheric locations. Extremely large CMEs passed the STEREO-A spacecraft, which was behind the West limb of the Sun, approximately 2-3 days before each near-Earth FD. Solar wind simulations suggest that the CMEs combined with pre-existing CIRs, enhancing the pre-existing barriers to GCR propagation. Thus these observations provide strong evidence for the modulation of GCR flux by remote solar wind structures.},

To explore this complexity, we created a citizen science project with the UK Science Museum, in which participants were shown pairs of CME images and asked to decide which image in each pair appeared the most 'complicated'. A Bradley‐Terry model was then applied to these data to rank the CMEs by their 'complicatedness', or 'visual complexity'. This complexity ranking revealed that the annual average visual complexity values follow the solar activity cycle, with a higher level of complexity being observed at the peak of the cycle. The average complexity of CMEs observed by STEREO‐A was also found to be significantly higher than those observed by STEREO‐B. Visual complexity was found to be associated with CME size and brightness, but our results suggest that complexity may be influenced by the scale‐sizes of structure in the CMEs.},

	abstract = {Accurate forecasting of the arrival time and arrival speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a unsolved problem in space weather research. In this study, a comparison of the predicted arrival times and speeds for each CME based, independently, on the inputs from the two STEREO vantage points is carried out. We perform hindcasts using ELlipse Evolution model based on Heliospheric Imager observations (ELEvoHI) ensemble modelling. An estimate of the ambient solar wind conditions is obtained by the Wang-Sheeley-Arge/Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation (WSA/HUX) model combination that serves as input to ELEvoHI. We carefully select 12 CMEs between February 2010 and July 2012 that show clear signatures in both STEREO-A and STEREO-B HI time-elongation maps, that propagate close to the ecliptic plane, and that have corresponding in situ signatures at Earth. We find a mean arrival time difference of 6.5 hrs between predictions from the two different viewpoints, which can reach up to 9.5 hrs for individual CMEs, while the mean arrival speed difference is 63 km s−1. An ambient solar wind with a large speed variance leads to larger differences in the STEREO-A and STEREO-B CME arrival time predictions (cc = 0.92). Additionally, we compare the predicted arrivals, from both spacecraft, to the actual in situ arrivals at Earth and find a mean absolute error of 7.5 ± 9.5 hrs for the arrival time and 87 ± 111 km s−1 for the arrival speed. There is no tendency for one spacecraft to provide more accurate arrival predictions than the other. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Different terrestrial space weather indicators (such as geomagnetic indices, transpolar voltage, and ring current particle content) depend on different coupling functions (combinations of near-Earth solar wind parameters), and previous studies also reported a dependence on the averaging timescale, τ. We study the relationships of the am and SME geomagnetic indices to the power input into the magnetosphere P α , estimated using the optimum coupling exponent α, for a range of τ between 1 min and 1 year. The effect of missing data is investigated by introducing synthetic gaps into near-continuous data, and the best method for dealing with them when deriving the coupling function is formally defined. Using P α , we show that gaps in data recorded before 1995 have introduced considerable errors into coupling functions. From the near-continuous solar wind data for 1996–2016, we find that α = 0.44 ± 0.02 and no significant evidence that α depends on τ, yielding P α ∝B 0.88 V sw1.90 (m sw N sw ) 0.23 sin 4 (θ/2), where B is the interplanetary magnetic field, N sw the solar wind number density, m sw its mean ion mass, V sw its velocity, and θ the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle in the geocentric solar magnetospheric reference frame.

We show that lognormal distributions work well for ap, but 21 because of the spread of Dst for low activity conditions, the optimum formulation for Dst leads to 22 distributions better described by something like the Weibull formulation. Annual means can be 23 estimated using telescope observations of sunspots and modelling, and so this allows the 24 Confidential manuscript submitted to Space Weather 2 distributions to be estimated at any given  between 3 hour and 1 year for any of the past 400 years, 25 which is another important step towards a useful space weather climatology. The algorithms apply 26 to the core of the distributions and can be used to predict the occurrence rate of "large" events (in 27 the top 5\% of activity levels): they may contain some, albeit limited, information relevant to 28 characterizing the much rarer "superstorm" events with extreme value statistics. The algorithm for 29 the Dst index is the more complex one because, unlike ap, Dst can take on either sign and future 30 improvements to it are suggested. 31},

Images of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Heliospheric Imager instruments on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft frequently contain rich structure. Here, we present analysis of the Earth-directed CME launched on 12 December 2008 in which we interpret the revealed structure as projections of separate discrete sections of the physical boundary of the CME. By comparing the relative position of the outer and inner “ghost” fronts seen in the STEREO Heliospheric Imager 1 cameras with the positions of features determined from three CME models, we show that the two fronts seen in the images correspond to the expected position of the flank and nose of the CME where the background solar wind is uniform. In contrast, the flank of the CME observed expanding into a structured background solar wind results in the elongation between the two fronts being greater than expected. This is consistent with the CME flank distorting in the presence of a high-speed solar wind stream. Further work is required to consolidate these results. The presence of a shock for this event was ruled out by consideration of the low CME speed and by studying in situ spacecraft data. The CME flank crossing the Thomson sphere was also ruled out as a cause of the ghost fronts. Ghost fronts could provide information about the longitudinal shape of the CME independent of geometric models. This technique could subsequently be used to improve space weather forecast models through techniques such as data assimilation.},

We present evidence that variability in the STEREO-A Heliospheric Imager (HI) data is correlated with in situ solar wind speed estimates from WIND, STEREO-A, and STEREO-B. For 2008–2012, we compute the variability in HI differenced images in a plane-of-sky shell between 20 to 22.5 solar radii and, for a range of position angles, compare daily means of HI variability and in situ solar wind speed estimates. We show that the HI variability data and in situ solar wind speeds have similar temporal autocorrelation functions. Carrington rotation periodicities are well documented for in situ solar wind speeds, but, to our knowledge, this is the first time they have been presented in statistics computed from HI images. In situ solar wind speeds from STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and WIND are all are correlated with the HI variability, with a lag that varies in a manner consistent with the longitudinal separation of the in situ monitor and the HI instrument. Unlike many approaches to processing HI observations, our method requires no manual feature tracking; it is automated, is quick to compute, and does not suffer the subjective biases associated with manual classifications. These results suggest we could possibly estimate solar wind speeds in the low heliosphere directly from HI observations. This motivates further investigation, as this could be a significant asset to the space weather forecasting community; it might provide an independent observational constraint on heliospheric solar wind forecasts, through, for example, data assimilation. Finally, these results are another argument for the potential utility of including a HI on an operational space weather mission.},

However, other hemispheric asymmetries in the aa index remain: in particular, the distributions of 3-hourly aa N and aa S values are different and the correlation between them is not high on this timescale ( r = 0.66). In the present paper, a location-dependant station sensitivity model is developed using the am index (derived from a much more extensive network of stations in both hemispheres) and used to reduce the difference between the hemispheric aa indices and improve their correlation (to r = 0.79) by generating corrected 3-hourly hemispheric indices, aa HN and aa HS , which also include the secular drift corrections detailed in Paper 1. These are combined into a new, “homogeneous” aa index, aa H . It is shown that aa H , unlike aa , reveals the “equinoctial”-like time-of-day/time-of-year pattern that is found for the am index.},

	abstract = {This is the second in a series of papers that investigate the semi-annual, annual and Universal Time ( UT ) variations in the magnetosphere. We present a varied collection of empirical results that can be used to constrain theories and modelling of these variations. An initial study of two years’ data on transpolar voltage shows that there is a semi-annual variation in magnetospheric flux circulation; however, it is not as large in amplitude as that in geomagnetic activity, consistent with the latter showing a non-linear (quadratic) variation with transpolar voltage. We find that during the persistent minimum of the UT variation in geomagnetic activity, between about 2 and 10 UT , there is also a persistent decrease in observed transpolar voltage, which may be, in part, caused by a decrease in reconnection voltage in the nightside cross-tail current sheet. We study the response of geomagnetic activity to estimated power input into the magnetosphere using interplanetary data from 1995 onwards, an interval for which the data are relatively free of data gaps. We find no consistent variation in the response delay with time-of-year F and, using the optimum lag, we show that the patterns of variation in F -year spectrograms are very similar for geomagnetic activity and power input into the magnetosphere, both for average values and for the occurrence of large events. The Russell–McPherron (R–M) mechanism is shown to be the central driver of this behaviour. However, the (R–M) effect on power input into the magnetosphere is small and there is a non-linear amplification of the semi-annual variation in the geomagnetic response, such that a very small asymmetry in power input into the magnetosphere P α between the “favourable” and “unfavourable” polarities of the IMF B Y component generates a greatly amplified geomagnetic response. The analysis strongly indicates that this amplification is associated with solar wind dynamic pressure and its role in squeezing the near-Earth tail and so modulating the storage and release of energy extracted from the solar wind. In this paper, we show that the equinoctial pattern is found in the residuals of fits of P α to the am index and that the amplitude of these equinoctial patterns in the am fit residuals increases linearly with solar wind dynamic pressure. Similarly, the UT variation in am is also found in these fit residuals and also increases in amplitude with solar wind dynamic pressure.},

	abstract = {We study the semi-annual variation in geomagnetic activity, as detected in the geomagnetic indices am , aa H , AL , Dst and the four aσ indices derived for 6-hour MLT sectors (around noon, dawn, dusk and midnight). For each we compare the amplitude of the semi-annual variation, as a fraction of the overall mean, to that of the corresponding variation in power input to the magnetosphere, P α , estimated from interplanetary observations. We demonstrate that the semi-annual variation is amplified in the geomagnetic data compared to that in P α , by a factor that is different for each index. The largest amplification is for the Dst index (factor {\textasciitilde} 10) and the smallest is for the aσ index for the noon MLT sector ( aσ -noon, factor ≈ 1.1). By sorting the data by the prevailing polarity of the Y -component (dawn-dusk) of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) in the Geocentric Solar Equatorial (GSEQ) reference frame, we demonstrate that the Russell-McPherron (R-M) effect, in which a small southward IMF component in GSEQ is converted into geoeffective field by Earth’s dipole tilt, is a key factor for the semi-annual variations in both P α and geomagnetic indices. However, the variability in the southward component in the IMF in the GSEQ frame causes more variability in power input to the magnetosphere P α than does the R-M effect, by a factor of more than two. We show that for increasingly large geomagnetic disturbances, P α delivered by events of large southward field in GSEQ (known to often be associated with coronal mass ejections) becomes the dominant driver and the R-M effect declines in importance and often acts to reduce geoeffectiveness for the most southward IMF in GSEQ: the semi-annual variation in large storms therefore suggests either preconditioning of the magnetosphere by average conditions or an additional effect at the equinoxes. We confirm that the very large R-M effect in the Dst index is because of a large effect at small and moderate activity levels and not in large storms. We discuss the implications of the observed “equinoctial” time-of-year ( F ) – Universal Time ( UT ) pattern of geomagnetic response, the waveform and phase of the semi-annual variations, the differences between the responses at the June and December solstices and the ratio of the amplitudes of the March and September equinox peaks. We also confirm that the UT variation in geomagnetic activity is a genuine global response. Later papers will analyse the origins and implications of the effects described.},

	abstract = {Near-Earth solar-wind conditions, including disturbances generated by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are routinely forecast using three-dimensional, numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere. The resulting forecast errors are largely the result of uncertainty in the near-Sun boundary conditions, rather than heliospheric model physics or numerics. Thus ensembles of heliospheric model runs with perturbed initial conditions are used to estimate forecast uncertainty. MHD heliospheric models are relatively cheap in computational terms, requiring tens of minutes to an hour to simulate CME propagation from the Sun to Earth. Thus such ensembles can be run operationally. However, ensemble size is typically limited to 10 1 to 10 2 members, which may be inadequate to sample the relevant high-dimensional parameter space. Here, we describe a simplified solar-wind model that can estimate CME arrival time in approximately 0.01 seconds on a modest desktop computer and thus enables significantly larger ensembles. It is a one-dimensional, incompressible, hydrodynamic model, which has previously been used for the steady-state solar wind, but it is here used in time-dependent form. This approach is shown to adequately emulate the MHD solutions to the same boundary conditions for both steady-state solar wind and CME-like disturbances. We suggest it could serve as a “surrogate” model for the full three-dimensional MHD models. For example, ensembles of 10 5 to 10 6 members can be used to identify regions of parameter space for more detailed investigation by the MHD models. Similarly, the simplicity of the model means it can be rewritten as an adjoint model, enabling variational data assimilation with MHD models without the need to alter their code. The model code is available as an Open Source download in the Python language.},

	abstract = {In this work we have, for the first time, applied the interpretation of multiple “ghost-fronts” to two synthetic coronal mass ejections (CMEs) propagating within a structured solar wind using the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation time (HUXt) solar wind model. The two CMEs occurred on 2012 June 13–14 showing multiple fronts in images from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Heliospheric Imagers (HIs). The HUXt model is used to simulate the evolution of these CMEs across the inner heliosphere as they interacted with structured ambient solar wind. The simulations reveal that the evolution of CME shape is consistent with observations across a wide range of solar latitudes and that the manifestation of multiple “ghost-fronts” within HIs’ field of view is consistent with the positions of the nose and flank of the same CME structure. This provides further confirmation that the angular separation of these features provides information on the longitudinal extent of a CME. For one of the CMEs considered in this study, both simulations and observations show that a concave shape develops within the outer CME front. We conclude that this distortion results from a latitudinal structure in the ambient solar wind speed. The work emphasizes that the shape of the CME cannot be assumed to remain a coherent geometrical shape during its propagation in the heliosphere. Our analysis demonstrates that the presence of “ghost” CME fronts can be used to infer the distortion of CMEs by ambient solar wind structure as a function of both latitude and longitude. This information has the potential to improve the forecasting of space weather events at Earth.},

	abstract = {Variability in near-Earth solar wind conditions gives rise to space weather, which can have adverse effects on space- and ground-based technologies. Enhanced and sustained solar wind coupling with the Earth's magnetosphere can lead to a geomagnetic storm. The resulting effects can interfere with power transmission grids, potentially affecting today's technology-centered society to great cost. It is therefore important to forecast the intensity and duration of geomagnetic storms to improve decision making capabilities of infrastructure operators. The 150 years aaH geomagnetic index gives a substantial history of observations from which empirical predictive schemes can be built. Here we investigate the forecasting of geomagnetic activity with two pattern-matching forecast techniques, using the long aaH record. The techniques we investigate are an Analogue Ensemble (AnEn) Forecast, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). AnEn produces a probabilistic forecast by explicitly identifying analogs for recent conditions in the historical data. The SVM produces a deterministic forecast through dependencies identified by an interpretable machine learning approach. As a third comparative forecast, we use the 27 days recurrence model, based on the synodic solar rotation period. The methods are analyzed using several forecast metrics and compared. All forecasts outperform climatology on the considered metrics and AnEn and SVM outperform 27 days recurrence. A Cost/Loss analysis reveals the potential economic value is maximized using the AnEn, but the SVM is shown as superior by the true skill score. It is likely that the best method for a user will depend on their need for probabilistic information and tolerance of false alarms.},

	abstract = {Space weather has long been known to approximately follow the solar cycle, with geomagnetic storms occurring more frequently at solar maximum than solar minimum. There is much debate, however, about whether the most hazardous events follow the same pattern. Extreme events – by definition – occur infrequently, and thus establishing their occurrence behaviour is difficult even with very long space-weather records. Here we use the 150-year \$aa\_\{H\}\$record of global geomagnetic activity with a number of probabilistic models of geomagnetic-storm occurrence to test a range of hypotheses. We find that storms of all magnitudes occur more frequently during an active phase, centred on solar maximum, than during the quiet phase around solar minimum. We also show that the available observations are consistent with the most extreme events occurring more frequently during large solar cycles than small cycles. Finally, we report on the difference in extreme-event occurrence during odd- and even-numbered solar cycles, with events clustering earlier in even cycles and later in odd cycles. Despite the relatively few events available for study, we demonstrate that this is inconsistent with random occurrence. We interpret this finding in terms of the overlying coronal magnetic field and enhanced magnetic-field strengths in the heliosphere, which act to increase the geoeffectiveness of sheath regions ahead of extreme coronal mass ejections. Putting the three “rules” together allows the probability of extreme event occurrence for Solar Cycle 25 to be estimated, if the magnitude and length of the coming cycle can be predicted. This highlights both the feasibility and importance of solar-cycle prediction for planning and scheduling of activities and systems that are affected by extreme space weather.},

Because the offset of the (eccentric dipole) geomagnetic pole from the rotational axis is roughly twice as large in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern, the effects there are predicted to be roughly twice the amplitude of those in the northern hemisphere. Hemispheric differences have previously been discussed in terms of polar ionospheric conductivities generated by solar photoionization, effects which we allow for by looking at the dipole tilt effect on the time-of-year variations of the indices. The electric field induced in a geocentric frame is shown to also be a significant factor and gives a modulation of the voltage applied by the solar wind flow in the southern hemisphere that is typically a ±30\% diurnal modulation for disturbed intervals rising to ±76\% in quiet times. For the northern hemisphere these are 15\% and 38\% modulations. Motion away from/towards the Sun reduces/enhances the directly-driven ionospheric voltages and reduces/enhances the magnetic energy stored in the tail and we estimate that approximately 10\% of the effect appears in directly driven ionospheric voltages and 90\% in changes of the rate of energy storage or release in the near-Earth tail. The hemispheric asymmetry in the geomagnetic pole offsets from the rotational axis is shown to be the dominant factor in driving Universal Time ({\textless}i{\textgreater}UT{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) variations and hemispheric differences in geomagnetic activity. Combined with the effect of solar wind dynamic pressure and dipole tilt on the pressure balance in the near-Earth tail, the effect provides an excellent explanation of how the observed Russell-McPherron pattern with time-of-year {\textless}i{\textgreater}F{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}UT{\textless}i/{\textgreater} in the driving power input into the magnetosphere is converted into the equinoctial {\textless}i{\textgreater}F{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-{\textless}i{\textgreater}UT{\textless}i/{\textgreater} pattern in average geomagnetic activity (after correction is made for dipole tilt effects on ionospheric conductivity), added to a pronounced {\textless}i{\textgreater}UT{\textless}i/{\textgreater} variation with minimum at 02–10 UT.

	abstract = {Predicting the arrival of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is one key objective of space weather forecasting. In operational space weather forecasting, solar wind numerical models are used for this task and ensemble techniques are being increasingly explored as a means to improve these forecasts. Currently, these forecasts are not constrained by the available in situ and remote sensing observations, such as those from the heliospheric imagers (HIs) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) STEREO spacecraft, which record white-light images of solar wind and CMEs. We report case studies of four CMEs and show how HI observations can be used to improve the skill and reduce the uncertainty of ensemble hindcasts of these events. Using a computationally efficient solar wind model, we produce 200-member ensemble hindcasts, perturbing the modeled CME parameters within uniform distributions about the best estimates. By comparing the trajectory of the modeled CME flanks with HI observations, we compute a weight for each ensemble member. Weighting the ensemble distribution of CME arrival times improves the skill and reduces the hindcast uncertainty of each event. For these four events, the weighted ensembles show a mean reduction in arrival time error of 20.1 ± 4.1\%, and a mean reduction in arrival time uncertainty of 15.0 ± 7.2\%, relative to the unweighted ensembles. This technique could be applied in operational space weather forecasting, if real-time HI observations were available. Therefore, as NASA and the European Space Agency are currently planning the next space weather monitoring missions, our proof-of-concept study provides some evidence of the potential value of including HIs on these missions.},

The differences in how the various indices vary with near-Earth interplanetary parameters, which are here exploited to separate the effects of the IMF and solar wind speed, are shown to be statistically significant at the 93\% level or above. Reconstructions are made using four combinations of different indices, compiled using different data and different algorithms, and the results are almost identical for all parameters. The correction to the aa index required is discussed by comparison with the A index from a more extensive network of mid-latitude stations. Data from the Helsinki magnetometer station is used to extend the aa index back to 1845 and the results confirmed by comparison with the nearby St Petersburg observatory. The optimum variations, using all available long-term geomagnetic indices, of the near-Earth IMF and solar wind speed, and of the open solar flux, are presented; all with ±2 \& sigma; uncertainties computed using the Monte Carlo technique outlined in the earlier papers.

	abstract = {© 2015 M.J. Owens et al. A Hale cycle, one complete magnetic cycle of the Sun, spans two complete Schwabe cycles (also referred to as sunspot and, more generally, solar cycles). The approximately 22-year Hale cycle is seen in magnetic polarities of both sunspots and polar fields, as well as in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays reaching Earth, with odd-and even-numbered solar cycles displaying qualitatively different waveforms. Correct numbering of solar cycles also underpins empirical cycle-to-cycle relations which are used as first-order tests of stellar dynamo models. There has been much debate about whether the unusually long solar cycle 4 (SC4), spanning 1784-1799, was actually two shorter solar cycles combined as a result of poor data coverage in the original Wolf sunspot number record. Indeed, the group sunspot number does show a small increase around 1794-1799 and there is evidence of an increase in the mean latitude of sunspots at this time, suggesting the existence of a cycle "4b". In this study, we use cosmogenic radionuclide data and associated reconstructions of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) to show that the Hale cycle has persisted over the last 300 years and that data prior to 1800 are more consistent with cycle 4 being a single long cycle (the "no SC4b" scenario). We also investigate the effect of cycle 4b on the HMF using an open solar flux (OSF) continuity model, in which the OSF source term is related to sunspot number and the OSF loss term is determined by the heliospheric current sheet tilt, assumed to be a simple function of solar cycle phase. The results are surprising; Without SC4b, the HMF shows two distinct peaks in the 1784-1799 interval, while the addition of SC4b removes the secondary peak, as the OSF loss term acts in opposition to the later rise in sunspot number. The timing and magnitude of the main SC4 HMF peak is also significantly changed by the addition of SC4b. These results are compared with the cosmogenic isotope reconstructions of HMF and historical aurora records. These data marginally favour the existence of SC4b (the "SC4b" scenario), though the result is less certain than that based on the persistence of the Hale cycle. Thus while the current uncertainties in the observations preclude any definitive conclusions, the data favour the "no SC4b" scenario. Future improvements to cosmogenic isotope reconstructions of the HMF, through either improved modelling or additional ice cores from well-separated geographic locations, may enable questions of the existence of SC4b and the phase of Hale cycle prior to the Maunder minimum to be settled conclusively.},

	abstract = {We develop a database of 110 gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events, over the period 1967-2006, providing estimates of event onset, duration, fluence, and peak flux for protons of energy E  {\textgreater}  60 MeV. The database is established mainly from the energetic proton flux data distributed in the OMNI 2 data set; however, we also utilize the McMurdo neutron monitor and the energetic proton flux from GOES missions. To aid the development of the gradual SEP database, we establish a method with which the homogeneity of the energetic proton flux record is improved. A comparison between other SEP databases and the database developed here is presented which discusses the different algorithms used to define an event. Furthermore, we investigate the variation of gradual SEP occurrence and fluence with solar cycle phase, sunspot number (SSN), and interplanetary magnetic field intensity (B mag ) over solar cycles 20-23. We find that the occurrence and fluence of SEP events vary with the solar cycle phase. Correspondingly, we find a positive correlation between SEP occurrence and solar activity as determined by SSN and B mag , while the mean fluence in individual events decreases with the same measures of solar activity. Therefore, although the number of events decreases when solar activity is low, the events that do occur at such times have higher fluence. Thus, large events such as the "Carrington flare" may be more likely at lower levels of solar activity. These results are discussed in the context of other similar investigations.

The SSN-based estimate of B, from 1750 to 2013, is a weighted composite of eight time series derived from two separate reconstruction methods applied to four different SSN time series, allowing determination of the uncertainty from both the underlying sunspot records and the B reconstruction methods. The SSN-based composite is highly correlated with direct spacecraft measurements of B and with the composite geomagnetic B time series from 1845 to 2013 (r = 0.91; MSE = 0.24 nT 2 ), demonstrating that B can accurately reconstructed by both geomagnetic and sunspot-based methods.

New sunspot data composites, some of which are radically different in the character of their long-term variation, are evaluated over the interval 1845-2014. The method commonly used to calibrate historic sunspot data, relative to modern-day data, is "daisy-chaining," whereby calibration is passed from one data subset to the neighboring one, usually using regressions of the data subsets for the intervals of their overlap. Recent studies have illustrated serious pitfalls in these regressions, and the resulting errors can be compounded by their repeated use as the data sequence is extended back in time. Hence, the recent composite data series by Usoskin et al., R  UEA , is a very important advance because it avoids regressions, daisy-chaining, and other common, but invalid, assumptions: this is achieved by comparing the statistics of "active-day" fractions to those for a single reference data set. We study six sunspot data series, including R  UEA  and the new "backbone" data series (R  BB , recently generated by Svalgaard  \&  Schatten by employing both regression and daisy-chaining). We show that all six can be used with a continuity model to reproduce the main features of the open solar flux variation for 1845-2014, as reconstructed from geomagnetic activity data. However, some differences can be identified that are consistent with tests using a basket of other proxies for solar magnetic fields. Using data from a variety of sunspot observers, we illustrate problems with the method employed in generating R  BB  that cause it to increasingly overestimate sunspot numbers going back in time, and we recommend using R  UEA  because it employs more robust procedures that avoid such problems.},

	abstract = {The Maunder minimum (MM) was a period of extremely low solar activity from approximately AD 1650 to 1715. In the solar physics literature, the MM is sometimes associated with a period of cooler global temperatures, referred to as the Little Ice Age (LIA), and thus taken as compelling evidence of a large, direct solar influence on climate. In this study, we bring together existing simulation and observational studies, particularly the most recent solar activity and paleoclimate reconstructions, to examine this relation. Using northern hemisphere surface air temperature reconstructions, the LIA can be most readily defined as an approximately 480 year period spanning AD 1440–1920, although not all of this period was notably cold. While the MM occurred within the much longer LIA period, the timing of the features are not suggestive of causation and should not, in isolation, be used as evidence of significant solar forcing of climate. Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use.},

Observations of this eclipse were used to investigate the high time resolution (1 min) decay and recovery of the Earths ionospheric E-region above the ionospheric monitoring station in Chilton, UK. At the altitude of this region (100 km), the maximum phase of the eclipse was 88.88\% obscuration of the photosphere occurring at 9:29:41.5 UT. In comparison, the ionospheric response revealed a maximum obscuration of 66\% (leaving a fraction, Φ, of uneclipsed radiation of 34 ±4\%) occurring at 9:29 UT. The eclipse was re-created using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory to estimate the fraction of radiation incident on the Earths atmosphere throughout the eclipse from nine different emission wavelengths in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray spectrum. These emissions, having varying spatial distributions, were each obscured differently during the eclipse. Those wavelengths associated with coronal emissions (94, 211 and 335) most closely reproduced the time varying fraction of unobscured radiation observed in the ionosphere. These results could enable historic ionospheric eclipse measurements to be interpreted in terms of the distribution of EUV and X-ray emissions on the solar disc.

	abstract = {© Author(s) 2017. This paper describes the recommended solar forcing dataset for CMIP6 and highlights changes with respect to CMIP5. The solar forcing is provided for radiative properties, namely total solar irradiance (TSI), solar spectral irradiance (SSI), and the F10.7 index as well as particle forcing, including geomagnetic indices Ap and Kp, and ionization rates to account for effects of solar protons, electrons, and galactic cosmic rays. This is the first time that a recommendation for solar-driven particle forcing has been provided for a CMIP exercise. The solar forcing datasets are provided at daily and monthly resolution separately for the CMIP6 preindustrial control, historical (1850-2014), and future (2015-2300) simulations. For the preindustrial control simulation, both constant and time-varying solar forcing components are provided, with the latter including variability on 11-year and shorter timescales but no long-term changes. For the future, we provide a realistic scenario of what solar behavior could be, as well as an additional extreme Maunder-minimum-like sensitivity scenario. This paper describes the forcing datasets and also provides detailed recommendations as to their implementation in current climate models. For the historical simulations, the TSI and SSI time series are defined as the average of two solar irradiance models that are adapted to CMIP6 needs: an empirical one (NRLTSI2-NRLSSI2) and a semi-empirical one (SATIRE). A new and lower TSI value is recommended: the contemporary solar-cycle average is now 1361.0 W m -2 . The slight negative trend in TSI over the three most recent solar cycles in the CMIP6 dataset leads to only a small global radiative forcing of -0.04 W m -2 . In the 200-400 nm wavelength range, which is important for ozone photochemistry, the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset shows a larger solar-cycle variability contribution to TSI than in CMIP5 (50 \% compared to 35 \%). We compare the climatic effects of the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset to its CMIP5 predecessor by using time-slice experiments of two chemistry-climate models and a reference radiative transfer model. The differences in the long-term mean SSI in the CMIP6 dataset, compared to CMIP5, impact on climatological stratospheric conditions (lower shortwave heating rates of -0.35 K day -1 at the stratopause), cooler stratospheric temperatures (-1.5 K in the upper stratosphere), lower ozone abundances in the lower stratosphere (-3 \%), and higher ozone abundances (+1.5 \% in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere). Between the maximum and minimum phases of the 11-year solar cycle, there is an increase in shortwave heating rates (+0.2 K day -1 at the stratopause), temperatures (∼ 1 K at the stratopause), and ozone (+2.5 \% in the upper stratosphere) in the tropical upper stratosphere using the CMIP6 forcing dataset. This solar-cycle response is slightly larger, but not statistically significantly different from that for the CMIP5 forcing dataset. CMIP6 models with a well-resolved shortwave radiation scheme are encouraged to prescribe SSI changes and include solar-induced stratospheric ozone variations, in order to better represent solar climate variability compared to models that only prescribe TSI and/or exclude the solar-ozone response. We show that monthly-mean solar-induced ozone variations are implicitly included in the SPARC/CCMI CMIP6 Ozone Database for historical simulations, which is derived from transient chemistry-climate model simulations and has been developed for climate models that do not calculate ozone interactively. CMIP6 models without chemistry that perform a preindustrial control simulation with time-varying solar forcing will need to use a modified version of the SPARC/CCMI Ozone Database that includes solar variability. CMIP6 models with interactive chemistry are also encouraged to use the particle forcing datasets, which will allow the potential long-term effects of particles to be addressed for the first time. The consideration of particle forcing has been shown to significantly improve the representation of reactive nitrogen and ozone variability in the polar middle atmosphere, eventually resulting in further improvements in the representation of solar climate variability in global models.},

Geophys. Res. 119, 5172, 2014a). Each sunspot number is fitted with terrestrial observations, or parameters derived from terrestrial observations to be linearly proportional to sunspot number, over a 30-year calibration interval of 1982 – 2012. The fits are then used to compute test sequences, which extend further back in time and which are compared to R ISNv 1 , R G , R BB , and R C . To study the long-term trends, comparisons are made using averages over whole solar cycles (minimum-to-minimum). The test variations are generated in four ways: i) using the IDV(1d) and IDV geomagnetic indices (for 1845 – 2013) fitted over the calibration interval using the various sunspot numbers and the phase of the solar cycle; ii) from the open solar flux (OSF) generated for 1845 – 2013 from four pairings of geomagnetic indices by Lockwood et al. (Ann. Geophys. 32, 383, 2014a) and analysed using the OSF continuity model of Solanki, Schüssler, and Fligge (Nature, 408, 445, 2000), which employs a constant fractional OSF loss rate; iii) the same OSF data analysed using the OSF continuity model of Owens and Lockwood (J.

In total, NEWEx collected 15 606 observations of air temperature, cloudiness and wind speed and direction from 309 locations across the UK, over a 3 h window spanning the eclipse period. The headline results were processed in near real time, immediately published online, and featured in UK national press articles on the day of the eclipse.

The primary driver of these hazards are coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Solar Stormwatch is a citizen science project in which volunteers participated in several activities which characterized CMEs in the remote sensing images from the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) instrument package on the twin STEREO spacecraft. Here we analyze the results of the “Track-it-back” activity, in which CMEs were tracked back through the COR1, COR2, and EUVI images. Analysis of the COR1, COR2, and EUVI data together allows CMEs to be studied consistently throughout the whole field of view spanned by these instruments (out to 15 R S ). A total of 4783 volunteers took part in this activity, creating a data set containing 23,801 estimates of CME timing, location, and size. We used these data to produce a catalogue of 41 CMEs, which is the first to consistently track CMEs through each of these instruments. We assess how the CME speeds, propagation directions, and widths vary as the CMEs propagate through the fields of view of the different imagers. In particular, we compare the observed CME deflections between the COR1 and COR2 fields of view to the separation between the CME source region and the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), demonstrating that in general, these CMEs appear to deflect toward the HCS, consistent with other modeling studies of CME propagation.},

	abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are episodic eruptions of solar plasma and magnetic flux that travel out through the solar system, driving extreme space weather. Interpretation of CME observations and their interaction with the solar wind typically assumes CMEs are coherent, almost solid-like objects. We show that supersonic radial propagation of CMEs away from the Sun results in geometric expansion of CME plasma parcels at a speed faster than the local wave speed. Thus information cannot propagate across the CME. Comparing our results with observed properties of over 400 CMEs, we show that CMEs cease to be coherent magnetohydrodynamic structures within 0.3 AU of the Sun. This suggests Earth-directed CMEs are less like billiard balls and more like dust clouds, with apparent coherence only due to similar initial conditions and quasi homogeneity of the medium through which they travel. The incoherence of CMEs suggests interpretation of CME observations requires accurate reconstruction of the ambient solar wind with which they interact, and that simple assumptions about the shape of the CMEs are likely to be invalid when significant spatial/temporal gradients in ambient solar wind conditions are present.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the rate at which the large-scale solar-wind structure evolves is important for both understanding the physical processes occurring in the corona and for space-weather forecast improvement. Models of the global corona and heliosphere typically assume that the ambient solar-wind structure is steady and corotates with the Sun, which is generally expected to be more valid at solar minimum than solar maximum, but this has not been well tested. Similarly, assimilation of solar-wind observations into models requires quantitative knowledge of how the reliability of the observations changes with age. In this study we examine 25 years of near-Earth in situ solar-wind observations and 45 years of observation-constrained solar-wind simulations to determine how much the 1-AU solar-wind speed, \$V\$, and radial magnetic-field component, \$B\_\{R\}\$, vary between consecutive Carrington rotations (CRs). For the in situ spacecraft observations, we find the rate of change of \$V\$and \$B\_\{R\}\$is similar during solar maximum and minimum, particularly when transient interplanetary coronal mass ejections are removed from the data. This is somewhat counter to expectations. Conversely, the rate of change in \$V\$and \$B\_\{R\}\$obtained from global heliospheric simulations is strongly correlated with the solar cycle, with the corona and heliosphere being more variable at solar maximum, as expected. Limiting the analysis of the simulations to the solar equatorial region, however, strongly reduces the difference between solar maximum and minimum, bringing the result into close agreement with the in situ observations. This latitudinal sensitivity is explained in terms of the global solar-wind structure over the solar cycle. For the purposes of assimilating in-ecliptic solar-wind observations, we suggest the uncertainty in \$V\$should increase by around 3 km s−1 per day since the observation was made and 0.1 nT per day for \$B\_\{R\}\$. For observations made at higher latitude, the effect of observation age will be solar-cycle dependent.},

	abstract = {Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are an impact of space weather that can occur during periods of enhanced geomagnetic activity. GICs can enter into electrical power grids through earthed conductors, potentially causing network collapse through voltage instability or damaging transformers. It would be beneficial for power grid operators to have a forecast of GICs that could inform decision making on mitigating action. Long lead-time GIC forecasting requires magnetospheric models as drivers of geoelectric field models. However, estimation of the geoelectric field is sensitive to high-frequency geomagnetic field variations, which operational global magneto-hydrodynamic models do not fully capture. Furthermore, an assessment of GIC forecast uncertainty would require a large ensemble of magnetospheric runs, which is computationally expensive. One solution that is widely used in climate science is “downscaling,” wherein sub-grid variations are added to model outputs on a statistical basis. We present proof-of-concept results for a method that temporally downscales low-resolution magnetic field data on a 1-hr timescale to 1-min resolution, with the hope of improving subsequent geoelectric field magnitude estimates. An analog ensemble (AnEn) approach is used to select similar hourly averages in a historical data set, from which we separate the high-resolution perturbations to add to the hourly average values. We find that AnEn outperforms the benchmark linear-interpolation approach in its ability to accurately drive an impacts model, suggesting GIC forecasting would be improved. We evaluated the ability of AnEn to predict extreme events using the FSS, HSS, cost/loss analysis and BSS, finding that AnEn outperforms the “do-nothing” approach.},

	abstract = {The evolution and propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in interplanetary space is still not well understood. As a consequence, accurate arrival time and arrival speed forecasts are an unsolved problem in space weather research. In this study, we present the ELlipse Evolution model based on HI observations (ELEvoHI) and introduce a deformable front to this model. ELEvoHI relies on heliospheric imagers (HI) observations to obtain the kinematics of a CME. With the newly developed deformable front, the model is able to react to the ambient solar wind conditions during the entire propagation and along the whole front of the CME. To get an estimate of the ambient solar wind conditions, we make use of three different models: Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation model (HUX), Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation with time dependence model (HUXt), and EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). We test the deformable front on a CME first observed in STEREO-A/HI on February 3, 2010 14:49 UT. For this case study, the deformable front provides better estimates of the arrival time and arrival speed than the original version of ELEvoHI using an elliptical front. The new implementation enables us to study the parameters influencing the propagation of the CME not only for the apex, but for the entire front. The evolution of the CME front, especially at the flanks, is highly dependent on the ambient solar wind model used. An additional advantage of the new implementation is given by the possibility to provide estimates of the CME mass.},

	abstract = {Geometric modeling of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is a widely used tool for assessing their kinematic evolution. Furthermore, techniques based on geometric modeling, such as ELEvoHI, are being developed into forecast tools for space weather prediction. These models assume that solar wind structure does not affect the evolution of the CME, which is an unquantified source of uncertainty. We use a large number of Cone CME simulations with the HUXt solar wind model to quantify the scale of uncertainty introduced into geometric modeling and the ELEvoHI CME arrival times by solar wind structure. We produce a database of simulations, representing an average, a fast, and an extreme CME scenario, each independently propagating through 100 different ambient solar wind environments. Synthetic heliospheric imager observations of these simulations are then used with a range of geometric models to estimate the CME kinematics. The errors of geometric modeling depend on the location of the observer, but do not seem to depend on the CME scenario. In general, geometric models are biased towards predicting CME apex distances that are larger than the true value. For these CME scenarios, geometric modeling errors are minimised for an observer in the L5 region. Furthermore, geometric modeling errors increase with the level of solar wind structure in the path of the CME. The ELEvoHI arrival time errors are minimised for an observer in the L5 region, with mean absolute arrival time errors of 8.2 ± 1.2 h, 8.3 ± 1.0 h, and 5.8 ± 0.9 h for the average, fast, and extreme CME scenarios.},
